# C++ and Visual Basic Programming Foundations for Aspiring Engineers

This repository contains a curated collection of **75+ programs** developed to strengthen practical understanding of **C++** and **Visual Basic** programming.

The projects span from **introductory console applications** to more **advanced graphical user interface (GUI) applications**, covering a wide range of core computer science and software engineering concepts, including:

-   Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
    
-   Data Structures and Algorithms
    
-   File Handling and I/O Operations
    
-   Control Structures and Program Design
    
-   GUI Development and Event-Driven Programming
    

Each program is **well-documented** and includes clear explanations of its purpose, implementation, and functionality, making this repository suitable both as a **learning resource** and as a **reference archive**.

This project represents a structured and progressive learning journey and has played a significant role in building strong foundations in software development and problem-solving.
